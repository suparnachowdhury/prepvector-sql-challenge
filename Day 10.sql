-- Day 10: Liker’s Liker
-- Difficulty: Hard

-- A dating website’s schema is represented by a table of people that like other people.
--  The table has three columns. One column is the user_id, 
-- another column is the date time that the like occurred,
-- and the last column is the liker_id which is the user_id of the user doing the liking.
-- Write a query to count the number of liker’s likers (the users that like the likers) if the liker has one.

-- drop table likes;


CREATE TABLE likes (
user_id VARCHAR(50),
created_at DATETIME,
liker_id VARCHAR(50)
